# C/C++ GHigh-Performance Keccak-256 AVX2 Implementation

This is a Keccak-256 hash library written in C (compatible with C++). specifically designed for achieving extreme computational speed. It has been deeply optimized by leveraging the AVX2 instruction set found in modern CPUs.

## Core Advantages

*   **Extreme Speed**: Significantly accelerates hash computations by utilizing AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) technology.
*   **8-Way Parallelism**: The core design supports processing 8 different sets of input data simultaneously, greatly enhancing throughput for bulk hashing operations.
*   **Deeply Optimized**: Incorporates various optimization strategies, such as full loop unrolling and adjustments for instruction-level parallelism, to maximize execution efficiency.
*   **Keccak Standard**: Implements the original Keccak padding rules (compatible with the `keccak256` function used in projects like Ethereum). Please note its slight difference from the FIPS 202 SHA3-256 standard.

## Suitable For

*   Applications with demanding speed requirements for Keccak-256 hash calculations.
*   Scenarios that require efficient processing of a large number of parallel hash tasks, such as blockchain technology, data verification, and high-performance computing.

## How to Integrate

Include the `keccak256_avx.c` and `keccak256_avx.h` files in your C project. AVX2 support needs to be enabled during compilation (e.g., using the `-mavx2` flag with GCC/Clang). For detailed API usage, please refer to the function declarations in the header file.


```
Compilation

gcc -O3 -mavx2 -mfma -march=native keccak_avx_test.c keccak256_avx.c -o keccak_avx_test
